Pair Programming
=================
Introduction
=============
This report describes  the experience of following pair programming methodology to develop a program to parse date/time
string in many different formats; implementation of the parsing program will be done using Java programming language.
Pair programming is achieved by two persons working on the same task, first person is the developer who write the code,
and the second person is the navigator , developer is responsible of writing the program source code, and the navigator
is just setting with developer to review the code and give feedback and ideas about implementation mechanisms, and also
to raise a hand if he noticed problem with the code written by developer.

Benefits of following pair programming methodology
==================================================
-	It motivates developer to provide best performance.
-	Cooperation between developer and navigator provides brand new ideas that both developer and navigator wouldn’t provide alone.
-	Pair programming increases the accuracy and minimizes bugs/issues with developed program.
-	Known mistakes like missing semicolon, or missing closing bracket can be noticed and corrected on the spot.

Difficulties of following pair programming methodology
=======================================================
-	When two resources are working on the same task, this is considered as waste of resources; in real development environment
project managers will not like this approach at all.
-	A lot of arguments happened between developer and navigator, this leads to much more time wasted.
-	Navigator interrupts developer many times; this makes it hard for developer to concentrate on the task in hand.

What would I change next time while applying pair programming
==============================================================
-	Use pair programming only for long tasks, as small tasks don’t fit with pair programming, actually time wasted in negotiation
and argument is much more than actual development time.
-	“Pair” should have enough understanding and common background to provide good results, if two persons don’t have common
background this will lead to more arguments and less cooperation.

Conclusion
==========
After using pair programming methodology for 2 hours in a small programming task, I came out with some facts about this software
methodology, it has many advantages as it boosts the overall accuracy especially when two persons have good communication skills 
and have some common background. 
On the other hand, pair programming has some drawbacks, it may lead to waste of time and resource and eventually waste of money
if it is used in the wrong situation, I think pair programming is best fit with tasks with long duration.
Finally, I think this research will help me a lot in taking the decision of using pair programming methodology or not based on
the task in hand. And in case of using it, I will make my best to overcome the difficulties that I have faced using 
pair programming.
